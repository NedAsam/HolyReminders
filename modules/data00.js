/* Introduction and invitation  */

    `Welcome and thank you for your interest in Opus Dei here in Western NY.`,
    `We are all pilgrims on our earthly journey, and, ultimately, as Christians,  we want to be greeted victoriously into eternal life. We should want to join St. Paul in declaring ...`,
    `"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing."[3]`,
    `However, "fighting the good fight" can seem rather daunting to most of us, much of the time. We read the lives of the saints, we experience the pressures of every day life, and we can be tempted to give up.`,
    `St. Josemaria Escriva spent his life doing the Work of God -- i.e. Opus Dei. Early on, it became clear to him that God wanted him to dedicate his life to helping all of us become saints while living out our every day lives in accordace with the will of God.`,
    `Toward that end, one can get to know St. Josmaria Escriva and begin to learn about Opus Dei by frequenting the <a href="https://opusdei.org">Opus Dei website.</a>`,
    `Further, this introductory website is a resource for keeping keeping track of the local Opus Dei activities (follow navigation links).`
