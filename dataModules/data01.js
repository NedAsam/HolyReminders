    `In response to Jesus' call, "Follow Me", Caravaggio depicts Mathew in a momentary state of indecision. His left hand is pointing back to himself as if to say "you mean me?", while his right hand remains with the money on the table. Then, Mathew decides -- "he got up and followed Him".`,
    `Jesus is calling each of us to follow Him. Like Mathew we each have our internal struggles. While our hearts may be wanting to follow Him, our day to day decisions and actions are more like Mathew's right hand -- back on the money. To keep our focus, we need support from other Christians.`,
