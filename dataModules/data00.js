const introduction = [
    `Welcome and thank you for your interest in Opus Dei here in Western NY.`,
    `We are all pilgrims on our earthly journey toward eternity. In this life, we all have our crosses -- anxieties, fears, illnesses, disappointments, regrets, et. al. In our hearts, we all desire to be able to echo St. Paul in declaring ...`,
    `"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing."<span class="footNoteRef">[3]</span>`,
    `However, "fighting the good fight" can seem rather daunting to most of us, much of the time. We read the lives of the saints, but we experience the pressures of every day life. We can be tempted to think that being "saintly" is only for those who live in convents or monastaries.`,
    `St. Josemaria Escriva was clearly aware of this flase mindset. Early on  in his priestly ministry he became convinced that God wanted him to help everyone to realize that they were all called by God to live saintly lives amidst their everyday activities. This led St. Josemaria Escriva to form what became know as "Opus Dei" -- i.e. "The Work of God."`,
    `To get to know St. Josmaria Escriva and  to learn about Opus Dei, begin  by frequenting the <a href="https://OpusDei.org">Opus Dei website.</a>`,
    `Further, this introductory website is a resource for keeping keeping track of the local Opus Dei activities (follow navigation links).`
